As the user can see that, the Calculate BMI screen page allows users to calculate their BMI and just fill in the height in cm and the weight in kg. After filling in, they can just click the calculate button to get the values of BMI. When users click the button, below will show the result and the categories of the BMI. If users consider recording their BMI result, they can just click the record button. After the user clicking the record button, will also display the date and time at the below, it means the user has recorded successfully.


# Gentle reminders
